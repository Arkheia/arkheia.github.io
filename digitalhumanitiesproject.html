						Before email, faculty meetings, international colloquia, and professional associations, the world of scholarship relied on its own networks: networks of correspondence that stretched across countries and continents; the social networks created by scientific academies; and the physical networks brought about by travel. These networks were the lifelines of learning, from the age of Erasmus to the age of Franklin. They facilitated the dissemination&emdash;and the criticism&emdash;of ideas, the spread of political news, as well as the circulation of people and objects. But what did these networks actually look like? Were they as extensive as we are led to believe? How did they evolve over time? 
					</p> 
					<p>Our projects are collaborative, use visualization, are open-ended, and have a conceptual focus on space and time. Our lab structure and culture is specifically designed to support iterative and exploratory processes where new questions and challenges arise â€“ the substance of which is often the most fruitful outcome of our exchanges.</p>
