						Though the field of the digital humanities has been steadily growing in popularity in the past decade or so, it still has a bit of an ambiguous definition—the intersection between the humanities and technology. One of the best ways to learn about the field is to explore examples of digital humanities projects, as well as the programs and technologies that can be used for digital curation, digital publishing, textual analysis, data visualization, mapping, and more. 
						<br><br>
						Especially if you’re interested in academic librarianship, or more specifically becoming a digital scholarship or digital humanities librarian, it’s important to be familiar with all of the digital tools that humanities scholars may need assistance with. After all, behind most digital humanities projects is a librarian who helped students and scholars learn and utilize these technologies for their research.
